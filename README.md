# Simple Micro Frontend

This project is an example of a micro frontend using Module Feredation

## Motivation

This project intend to be a simple and scalable boilerplate of a micro frontend, in it I used the [Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation), to better understand I recommend accessing the following links:

## Installation

After cloning the repository, you must run the command below at the root of the project:

```bash
yarn install-all
```

> You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Running

Run the command below to start the applications: `dashboard`, `profile` and `projects`

```bash
yarn start-all
```

or if you prefer you can run the command below for each project: `dashboard`, `profile` and `projects`

```bash
yarn start
```

The ports of each project:

| Project   | Port   |
| --------- | ------ |
| dashboard | `3000` |
| profile   | `3001` |
| projects  | `3002` |

## Project structure

The project structure presented is just an example, here I tried to make it as simple and scalable as possible:

```
.
├── dashboard                # Full dashboard using the `profile` and` projects` page.
├── profile                  # Profile containing only the profile page and related components.
├── projects                 # Projects containing only the projects page and related components.
```

Internal structure of each project:

```
.
├── public                   # Public files
├── src                      # Application code source
│ ├── components             # Generic application components
│ ├── styles                 # Generic application styles
│ ├── views                  # Pages used on the router
│ ├── App.js                 # Main application bootstrap with routes
│ ├── bootstrap.js           # Responsible for importing App.js and rendering in the DOM
│ ├── index.js               # Performs async import from bootstrap.js
└── webpack.config.js        # Bundler the all project and also where modules are exported so that projects can be reused
